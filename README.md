# PasswordManager
Simple Powershell password manager

<h1>TO USE</h1>

1.) Download or copy the code in the Password-Manager.psm1 file Switch the branch to GUI if you want the GUI version.

2.) Open Powershell.

3.) Type "Import-Module {Path To Module}".

4.) To add to your profile, type "Add-ToProfile" into Powershell.

5.) Use "Get-Command -Module Password-Manager" to get all available commands

<h1> Goals </h1>
<p>The main goal of this project is to build a password manager so quick and easy to use, you can get and set passwords within seconds. The idea is to provide short aliases like gpw (Get-Password) and spw (Set-Password) to the user and let them have at it.</p>

<h1> News </h1>
<p>Password manager is getting a GUI! </p>
<p>I've begun work on a C# WPF based GUI that will integrate all of the same features of the command line version, including random generation, simple and quick password getting and setting, etc. ETA will be provided once I touch up on a few things. Package will of course be posted here. I'll likely place it in another branch of the PasswordManager repo. </p>
<p>Note: Updates will continue to come to the Command Line Password Manager as well </p>
