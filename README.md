<h1> News </h1>
<p>Password manager is getting a GUI! </p>
<p>I've begun work on a C# WPF based GUI that will integrate all of the same features of the command line version, including random generation, simple and quick password getting and setting, etc. ETA will be provided once I touch up on a few things. Package will of course be posted here. I'll likely place it in another branch of the PasswordManager repo. </p>
<p>Note: Updates will continue to come to the Command Line Password Manager as well </p>
