# PasswordManager
Simple Powershell password manager, mine got taken away :(

TO USE:

1.) Download or copy the code in the Password-Manager.ps1 file.

2.) Run the PowerShell script.

3.) If you'd like to use the password manager on PowerShell startup, type the command "Add-ToProfile", and enter the location of the password manager script.

4.) Set up a new password by typing "spw", or Set-Password.

5.) Get the password by typing "gpw", or Get-Passwords.
i.) To remove passwords, navigate to %appdata%\PasswordManager\passwords and delete the respective files. (Note: In the future I'll create a delete function for this.)
